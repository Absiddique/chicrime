Chicago Crime Visualization and Analysis
========
The code here is for a Shiny App found at <a href="https://miningchi2.shinyapps.io/chicrime/" target=" blank">MiningChi.com</a> that allows you to visualize and analyze Chicago's crime statistics.  Some specifics include:

+ Finding crimes on a map
+ Analyzing crimes over time
+ A time series analysis that separates out the seasonal components from longer term trends
+ A heat map
+ The relationship between weather and crime
+ The underlying crime data 

To use the site, simply enter a crime type of your choice (e.g. Theft).  

Additional options include changing the date range (the site contains data from 2001 to 2014) and the community area.  There is also an option to change the period of analysis, which is useful for functions that aggregate crimes over time.

When using the maps, you can recenter by map by choosing a different location, either by city name or zip code.  You can also zoom as well as change the type of map.

This site is designed for people to learn and explore relationships in crime data. Portions of the site may have errors/slowdowns if you either try to query too much data or have a query that is too narrow.

All the data and and code for this site are all freely available.  If you are interested in data visualization, statistics, or crime - then join us!
